<h3> Project Description </h3>

Source: [Datacamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/)

<p align="justify">In this Project, I scraped the novel Moby Dick from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package <code>requests</code>.
Then extracted words from this web data using <code>BeautifulSoup</code>. Finally, analyzed the distribution of words using the <code>Natural Language ToolKit (nltk)</code>. The natural language processing tools used here apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text.</p>
