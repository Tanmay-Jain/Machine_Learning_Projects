    "### What is Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is a field within Natural Language Processing (NLP) concerned with identifying and classifying subjective opinions from text. Sentiment analysis ranges from detecting emotions (e.g., anger, happiness, fear), to sarcasm and intent (e.g., complaints, feedback, opinions). In its simplest form, sentiment analysis assigns a polarity (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) to a piece of text.\n",

    "### Project Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you guess whether a person felt positively or negatively about an experience, just from a short review they wrote?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, analyzed sentiments, created models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an example of classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented logistic regression classifier, analyzed the accuracy of classifier and found out the most positive and negative reviews.  "
