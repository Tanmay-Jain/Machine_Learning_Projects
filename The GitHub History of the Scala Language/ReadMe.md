<h2>Project Description</h2>

Source : [Datacamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/)

This project is about seeking the history of the Scala-Language and what its used for in development. The language is always getting updates and patches. 

The dataset used, has been previously mined and extracted directly from GitHub, is comprised of two files:

- pulls.csv contains the basic information about the pull requests.
- pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request.

In this project, I used visualizations to study the Scala project, plotting contributions over time to show activity, and looking for recent contributors.
