<h2>Project Description</h2><br>

<p align = "justify">This dataset comprises songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock). In this project, I trained a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). </p>

<p align = "justify">Initially, I used <code>pandas</code> and <code>seaborn</code> packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors. Next, I used the <code>scikit-learn</code> package to correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. Lastly, implemented common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression and decision trees.</p>

<p align = "justify">To summarize, I applied data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning using the <code>scikit-learn</code> package.</p>
