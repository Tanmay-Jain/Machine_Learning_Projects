# Machine_Learning_Projects
<hr>
In this project, we will implement several machine learning algorithms in Python using Scikit-learn, the most popular machine learning package for Python. Using a simple dataset for the task of training a classifier to distinguish between different types of fruits.The fruits dataset was created by Dr. Iain Murray from University of Edinburgh. He bought a few dozen oranges, lemons and apples of different varieties, and recorded their measurements in a table. And then the professors at University of Michigan formatted the fruits data slightly and it can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/susanli2016/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/fruit_data_with_colors.txt)
