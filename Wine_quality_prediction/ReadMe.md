<h3> Data Description</h3>

Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository Wine Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)

<p align="justify">The data includes information about red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. Data have 11 features: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol.<p/>

<p align="justify">The task here is to predict the quality of red wine on a scale of 0â€“10 given a set of features as inputs. I have solved it as a regression problem using Linear Regression.<p/>
